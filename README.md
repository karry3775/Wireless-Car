# Wireless-Car
The basic idea of this project is simple. There is Serial communication between NodeMcu and Arduino using the SoftwareSerial library found in Arduino.
The NodeMcu is further used to create a webserver over a local network (I used mobile's hotspot). Python is used as a client to make requests to the server. Whenas Python make any requests its essentially trying to access a very specific url. This url holds importance in the NodeMcu code since that is used to send serial commands to the Arduino. Based on the character sent over the serial Arduino makes decisions. In this simple demonstrative project, 0 and 1 are being sent based on specific requests made by the python client. If 0 is received car is stopped in its tracks and if 1 is received car is moved forward. Th python client used in this project makes the car move for 1 second and then stops. Due to inherent uncertainities present in the car, it might not move for the exact amount of time.
